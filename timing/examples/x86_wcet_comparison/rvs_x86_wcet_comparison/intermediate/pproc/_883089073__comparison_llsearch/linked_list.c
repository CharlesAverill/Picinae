/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _ISOC23_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C23.
   _ISOC2X_SOURCE	Old name for _ISOC23_SOURCE.
   _ISOC2Y_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C23 from ISO C2Y.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__
			ISO C23 interfaces defined only in Annex F.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE_SOURCE Select correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1, 2 or 3; 3 performs stricter checks than 2, which
			performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE

   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

   macro.  Most but not all symbols enabled by that macro in TS
   18661-1 are enabled unconditionally in C23.  In C23, the symbols in
   Annex F still require a new feature test macro
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__ instead (C23 does not define
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__), while a few features from TS
   18661-1 are not included in C23 (and thus should depend on
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__ even when C23 features are
   enabled).

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT) controls those features from TS
   18661-1 not included in C23.

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_BFP_EXT_C23) controls those features from TS
   18661-1 that are also included in C23 (with no feature test macro
   required in C23).

   __GLIBC_USE (IEC_60559_EXT) controls those features from TS 18661-1
   that are included in C23 but conditional on
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__.  (There are currently no features
